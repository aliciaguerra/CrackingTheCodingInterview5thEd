14.1. In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?
Declaring a constructor private on Class A means that you can only access the (private) constructor if you could
also access A's private methods. Who other than A, can access A's private methods and constructor? A's inner classes
can. Additionally, if A is an inner class of Q, then Q's inner classes can.
This has direct implications for inheritance, since a subclass calls it's parent's constructor. The class A can be inherited,
but only by its own and its parent's inner classes.
