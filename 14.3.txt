14.3 What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
Despite their similar sounding names, final, finally, and finalize serve very different purposes. 
To speak in very general terms, final is used to control whether a variable, method, or class is "changeable".
The finally keyword is used in a try/catch block to ensure that a segment of code is always executed.
The finalize() method is called by a garbage collector once it determines that no more references exist.

final
The final statement has a different meaning depending on its context.
-when applied to a variable (primitive): the value of the variable cannot change
-when applied to a variable (reference): The reference variable cannot point to any other object in a heap
-when applied to a method: the method cannot be overriden
-when applied to a class: the class cannot be subclassed

finally
There is an optional finally block after the try block or after the catch block. Statements in the finally
block will always be executed (except if JVM exits from the try block). The finally block is used to write the
clean up code.
